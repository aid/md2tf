# md2tf Test File 1

Here is some Terraform code:

```tf
resource provider_element1 element1 {
    element1_variable = "element1_value"
}
```

This is not Terraform code as it does not have the language identifier:

```
resource provider_element2 element2 {
    element2_variable = "element2_value"
}
```

And now we move back to Terraform code:

```tf
resource provider_element3 element3 {
    element3_variable = "element3_value"
}
```

File test1_input.md finished.
