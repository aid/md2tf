# # md2tf Test File 2
# 
# Here is some Terraform code:
# 
# ```tf
resource provider_element1 element1 {
    element1_variable = "element1_value"
}
# ```
# 
# This is not Terraform code as it has a diffeent langauge identifier - but one that does start with `tf`:
# 
# 
# ```tfsomething
# resource provider_element2 element2 {
#     element2_variable = "element2_value"
# }
# ```
# 
# And here we go back to normal Terraform, but with spaces on the end of the language:
# 
# ```tf    
resource provider_element3 element3 {
    element3_variable = "element3_value"
}
# ```
# 
# ## Finish
# 
# File test4_input.md finished.
